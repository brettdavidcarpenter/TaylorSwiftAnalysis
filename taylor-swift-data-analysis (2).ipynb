Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.\n2. **Explicit Lyric** Status: Whether or not the track has explicit lyrics ( True = yes it does; False = no it does not OR unknown).\n3. **Mode**: Indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\n\nNumerical Features\n\n4. **Song Duration** (ms): Length of the track in ms.=\n5. **Acousticness**: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. The closer this value is to 1.0, the greater the confidence that the track is acoustic. An example song with high acousticness is Offing by Julianna Barwick (acousticness = 0.996), while an example song with a low acousticness is Memory Machine by Dismemberment Plan (acousticness = 0.003320).\n6. **Danceability**: Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable. An example song with a high danceability is Leave Me Now by Herbert (danceability = 0.985), while an example of a song with low danceability is Surf by Fennesz (danceability = 0.0636)\n7. **Energy**: Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. An example of a song with high energy is When Doves Cry by Prince (energy = 0.989), while an example of a song with low energy is Zawinul/Lava by Brian Eno (energy = 0.010600)\n8. **Instrumentalness**: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.\n9. **Liveness**: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.\n10. **Speechiness**: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.\n11. **Tempo** (bmp): The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\n12. **Valence**: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry). An example of a song with high valence is Don’t Laugh (I Love You) by Ween (valence = 0.983), while an example of a song with low valence is Hedphelym by Aphex Twin (valence = 0.0188)\n13. **Popularity**: The popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.\n\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Introducing Data\nWe'll start to load the data and see what it looks like","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport random\n\n# Models\nfrom sklearn import ensemble\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVR\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, SGDRegressor\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet\nimport xgboost as xg \nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error, mean_gamma_deviance\n\n# Data Vis\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# LOOK AT FIELD TYPES\nraw = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/taylor-swift-spotify-dataset/taylor_swift_spotify.csv', index_col=0)\ndf = raw.drop(['id', 'uri'], axis=1)\ndf.drop_duplicates(inplace = True)\ndf.head(10)\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-07T19:25:26.285259Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-07T19:25:26.285815Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-07T19:25:29.532547Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-07T19:25:26.285714Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-07T19:25:29.531207Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The Shape of You\n*Applying these Features to Taylor*\n* Correlation Matrix: how to read it, takeaways\n* Descriptive stats","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Feature Correlation\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\ncorr = raw.corr()\nsns.heatmap(corr,annot=True,cmap=\"coolwarm\")","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-07T19:25:29.535128Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-07T19:25:29.536394Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-07T19:25:31.094970Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-07T19:25:29.536326Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-07T19:25:31.093683Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Correlations:\n\n1) Expected: There is a strong positive link between loudness and energy (0.80).\n\n2) Expected: There is a strong negative link between loudness/energy and acousticness (-0.72 & -0.73)\n\n3) Unexpected:  Instrumental songs have a negative impact on the popularity of a song (-0.53)\n\n4) Unexpected: Valence has a  strong negative correlation with the length of a song.
